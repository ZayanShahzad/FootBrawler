# FootBrawler


This project heavily focuses on classes and object which is what ive leanrt early on before making this project. If your not familiar with this type of game it basically consists of a barat the bottom which you could move left and right using certain keys, in this prject i use the MousedPressed method to make my own choices of what keys to use to which i made X the key to move right and Z to move left. 
With the bar you would have to stop as many balls that comes downtowards the bar and they can spawn in at any speed and and position. At the top left corner of the screen there would b a scoreboard starting from zero and evertime the ball comes into conatact with the bar the number increases which then causes the bar to either increase in speed or increase its spawn rate making it harder for you to catch the ball.
